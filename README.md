# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer cases using machine learning algorithms.

## **Dataset Features**
The dataset contains the following columns:
- `Age`
- `Race`
- `Marital Status`
- `T Stage`
- `Stage`
- `6th Stage`
- `Differentiate`
- `Grade`
- `A Stage`
- `Tumor Size`

## **Data Preprocessing and Visualization**

## **Machine Learning Models**
The following ML classification algorithms were applied:
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)
5. Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
6. Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC)

## **Model Performance**
| Model                 | Accuracy  |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 89.68%    |
| Random Forest         | **98.24%** |
| Support Vector Machine| 85.05%    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors   | 86.62%    |
| Decision Tree         | 83.76%    |
| Gradient Boosting     | 90.35%    |

The Random Forest Classifier gave the best performance with an accuracy of **98.24%**.
